# 🎙️ Session 0 – What and Why: Foundations for Mobile Development

## 🧭 Why Mobile Development?
Today, nearly everything we use is accessed on our phones — from banking and shopping to learning and gaming. Mobile apps offer the fastest path to users, which makes mobile development a high-impact skill. Whether you're a future startup founder, designer, or engineer, learning to build for mobile gives you the tools to bring ideas directly to people's pockets.

## ⚛️ What is React Native?
React Native is a JavaScript framework created by Meta (Facebook) that lets us build native apps using React. This means:

We write once in JavaScript.

The app runs on both iOS and Android.

We use familiar tools like components, props, and state.
Unlike traditional native development (Java for Android, Swift for iOS), React Native lets us build cross-platform apps without having to master two separate ecosystems.

## 🚀 What is Expo and Expo Go?
Expo is a framework and toolkit built on top of React Native that makes development easier. It handles the heavy lifting:

Pre-configured project setup

Easy access to camera, sensors, file system

One command to launch your app
With Expo Go, a free app you install on your phone, you can scan a QR code and immediately test your app without needing to compile anything.

✅ Think of Expo as your "power toolset" for React Native.

## 🛠️ Why GitHub and GitHub Codespaces?
GitHub is where we store, share, and collaborate on code. It keeps track of changes and lets us work with others.

GitHub Codespaces takes this a step further — it lets you:

Code inside a browser

Use VS Code in the cloud

Avoid setup headaches (no need to install Node.js, Expo, or anything locally)

✅ Students just open the Codespace, start coding, and run Expo — no local setup needed.


## 🧩 Putting It All Together
In this course, you'll build a mobile app using:

React Native for frontend logic and layout

Expo to simplify development and testing

GitHub & Codespaces for writing and sharing code without setup
